# Python-Virtual-envorment
A virtual environment is an isolated environment for Python projects. Inside a virtual environment we can have a completely independent set of packages (dependencies) and settings that will not conflict with anything in other virtual environment or with the default local Python environment.
This means we can keep different versions of the same package, e.g. we can use scikit-learn 0.1 for one project, and scikit-learn 0.22 for another project on the same system but in different virtual environments.
Requirements
An installation of Python
